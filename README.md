# Euler Problems
## Solutions in Java

Solutions to some of the problems from https://projecteuler.net/
This project has helped me to understand Java better, and also allowed me to work on more complex algorithms, making use of reusable functions and building my knowledge of both areas of maths and Java libraries.

The solutions are by no means optimised. As a learning exercise my first priority is to create a solution that will work, and then to work on building a solution that can work faster.
